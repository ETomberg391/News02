# üì∞ AI News Digest Generator

This Python script automatically fetches news articles from RSS feeds, summarizes them using a local LLM (via Ollama), writes a coherent broadcast-style script, and generates a text-to-speech (TTS) audio file of the broadcast.

## ‚ú® Features

- Pulls articles from any RSS feed (configurable via `feeds.yaml`)
- Summarizes news using a local LLM (Ollama)
- Generates a flowing, anchor-style news script
- Converts the script into an MP3 audio broadcast using Microsoft Edge TTS
- Saves both text and audio versions with timestamped filenames

---

## üîß Configurable Models

You can easily modify which models or voices to use by changing these variables at the top of the script:

```python
# === CONFIGURABLE MODELS ===
SUMMARY_MODEL = 'mistral:latest'            # For summarizing articles
BROADCAST_MODEL = 'mistral-small:24b-instruct-2501-q8_0'  # For combining summaries into a narrative
TTS_VOICE = "en-US-GuyNeural"               # Microsoft Edge TTS voice

üöÄ Running the Script

python your_script_name.py

The script will:
	‚Ä¢	Fetch one article per feed
	‚Ä¢	Summarize each
	‚Ä¢	Generate a full news digest
	‚Ä¢	Save the digest as digest_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.md
	‚Ä¢	Save an audio file as digest_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.mp3

‚∏ª

üó£Ô∏è Voice Options

You can change the voice used for TTS by editing the TTS_VOICE variable. Supported voices include:
	‚Ä¢	en-US-GuyNeural (default, male)
	‚Ä¢	en-US-JennyNeural (female)
	‚Ä¢	en-GB-RyanNeural (UK male)
	‚Ä¢	en-IN-PrabhatNeural (Indian English male)

üß† Customization Tips
	‚Ä¢	Adjust max_articles in fetch_articles() to increase the number of articles per feed.
	‚Ä¢	Modify the summarize_with_ollama() and generate_broadcast() prompts for a different tone or depth.
	‚Ä¢	Swap SUMMARY_MODEL or BROADCAST_MODEL to use other Ollama-supported models like llama3, gemma, etc.

‚∏ª

üìÅ Output
	‚Ä¢	Markdown news summary file
	‚Ä¢	Matching MP3 file with TTS narration

Files are saved in the same directory by default. You can change output_dir in save_digest().
